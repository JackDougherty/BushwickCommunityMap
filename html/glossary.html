		<h2>Likely Rent Stabilized</h2>         

		<p>New York City has a complex array of Rent Stabilization Laws and regulations. The buildings highlighted in this layer we are calling “Likely Rent-Stabilized”. They are buildings built before 1974 and contain 6 or more units. However, some of these buildings might no longer be rent-stabilized. <br> Generally, the only buildings covered by rent stabilization law are those built before 1974 that have 6 or more units. Newer buildings may qualify if the building has received certain tax benefits. There is also a process where older buildings can also be deregulated, meaning they are no longer are legally rent-stabilized. The rent of a rent stabilized unit can only be raised a certain percentage every year and the tenant must be offered a lease renewal. However, not every buildings qualifies.</p>
   
		<h2>Vacant Land</h2>         
		
		<p>This is land without a building. It could be vacant for any number of reasons. Who owns it will provide a clue as to why. Perhaps it's owned by a utility company or the government who are holding it for some reason. It could be owned by an absentee owner. Or an owner might be holding on it waiting for building permits or to re-sell it.</p>

		<h2>FAR</h2>
		
		<p>FAR stands for Floor Area Ratio. It's a zoning regulation that determines the maximum floor area (total sq. feet) that a building is allowed to have. The FAR, combined with other regulations, limits how high and how many units a building may have. <br> Buildings can be built or renovated to contain up to the maximum allowable FAR 'as of right', meaning they do not need special permission to do so. An owner with a property far below the maximum might decide to evict his/her tenants and rebuild with more units in order to collect more rent. <br> For example, a building on a 2500 square foot lot with a two-floor, two-family house might be able to double in size, or floor area, which would make the building appealing to a developer looking to maximize profits. This might mean a 2-family house becomes an 8-unit apartment building. Though it is unofficial, some city officials suggest that developers are most likely to invest in properties that they can rebuild to 150% or more its current size.</p>
 
		<h2>Rent Controlled v. Rent Stabilized</h2>
		
		<p>In New York City, Rent Control tenants are generally in buildings built before February 1, 1947, where the tenant is in continuous occupancy prior to July 1, 1971. Tenants who took occupancy after June 30, 1971, in buildings of six or more units built before January 1, 1974, are generally Rent Stabilized. See:  <a href="http://www.nyshcr.org/rent/faqs.htm#rsrc1">www.nyshcr.org</a></p>

		<h2>DOB Violation</h2>
		
		<p>A DOB Violation is a notice that a property is not in compliance with some provision of applicable law and includes an order from the Commissioner of the Department of Buildings to correct the violating condition. The violation is entered against the property in the Department's Buildings Information System (BIS), and must be corrected before a new or amended Certificate of Occupancy (CO) can be obtained.

		<p>The New York City Charter requires certain actions that are reviewed by the City Planning Commission to undergo a Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP). ULURP is a standardized procedure whereby applications affecting the land use of the city would be publicly reviewed.  The Charter also established mandated time frames within which application review must take place. Key participants in the ULURP process are now the Department of City Planning (DCP) and the City Planning Commission (CPC), Community Boards, the Borough Presidents, the Borough Boards, the City Council and the Mayor.</p>
